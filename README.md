# Employees Table ✨

[LIVE DEMO](https://nadiiabulmak.github.io/js_table_app/)

This project is a dynamic table displaying employee information. It includes sorting and adding new employees with a form. The table allows users to interact with it by double-clicking to edit cells and sorting the data by different columns. The form also includes basic validation to ensure the data is correct before submission. Notifications are displayed to give feedback on actions such as form submissions or errors. 🌟
